# IST-CEB-Lab1 2022/2023 | [L1 - Amplifier with BJTs](Labs_2023_v0.pdf)

## Overview
This laboratory work aims to analyze an amplifier circuit with bipolar transistors. The discrete amplifier consists of two cascaded amplification stages using NPN bipolar transistors BC547B. The focus includes studying the quiescent operating point, voltage gains, input and output resistances in the passband, and frequency response.

## Contents of the Laboratory Work
- **Analysis:** Conduct a theoretical analysis of the amplifier circuit with bipolar transistors.
- **Simulation:** Use the LTspice program for electrical simulations to validate the theoretical analysis and obtain performance characteristics of the amplifier.
- **Circuit Assembly:** Assemble the amplifier circuit on a breadboard and perform practical measurements.

## Objectives
- Understand the operation of an amplifier with bipolar transistors.
- Analyze the quiescent operating point, voltage gains, and input/output resistances in the passband.
- Explore the frequency response of the amplifier.
